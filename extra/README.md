## Info ðŸ“–
All my non-linux themes so people can stop asking for them. (And a way for me to store them because i always fucking lose them).

  â€¢ **VS Code**: [Theme](https://github.com/paradise-theme/vscode) | [JSON file](https://github.com/asteriau/dotfiles/blob/main/extra/VS%20code/settings.json) <br>
  â€¢ **Discord**: [Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asteriau/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/extra/Discord/Discord.css) <br>

## Installation ðŸ”§

### Discord

Discord broke basically every theme after their little update. You can still try applying it via vencord :
```

```
If you use another client, you'll have to manually copy and paste it into your quickcss.
